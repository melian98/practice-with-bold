This repository contains the R code for a nucleotide diversity assessment that checks for the nucleotide diversity of a species of frog depending on latitude

Nucleotide_diversity.r: This file contains the r code that downloads all data on the frog order from the BOLD database. The data is filtered and a nucleotide diversity analysis is conducted on the species with the highest number of hits in a variety of latitudes. The analysis checks for the nucleotide diversity in the tropical regions of the earth compared to the hemispheres

Anura_BOLD.tsv: This file contains the data downloaded from the BOLD database
